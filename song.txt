Prime Circle "As long As I am here"

I find that I am shaking
From my head down to my feet
My hands are sweating so bad
And I can barely speak
Read between the lines here
But dunno what to think
It's a guessing game


Was it the face?
Was it the moves?
Was it the way that she just knew me?
Was it the meaning behind every smile?
I try to walk, but can't leave
Her eyes, they pierce right through me
But I don't care
As long as I am here

I can't move 'cause I'm under her spell
Can't breathe as a side-effect from this
And I know that this will be the ends of me
I can't move 'cause I'm under her spell
Can't breathe as a side-effect from this
And I don't care
As long as I am here
Oh, my head's a mess, what it were
But at the same time clearer
And I'm feeling so content
But unsure
Reaching out, reaching in
Wish I knew what you were dreaming
And I never want to ever let this go
Yeah
Can't move 'cause I'm under her spell
Can't breathe as a side-effect from this
And I know that this will be the ends of me
I can't move 'cause I'm under her spell
Can't breathe as a side-effect from this
And I don't care
As long as I am here
As long as I am here, yeah
As long as I am here
As long as I am here
As long as I am here
As long as I am here
As long as I am here
