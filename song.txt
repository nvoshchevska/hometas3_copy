I find that I am shaking
From my head down to my feet
My hands are sweating so bad
And I can barely speak
Read between the lines here
But dunno what to think
It's a guessing game


Was it the face?
Was it the moves?
Was it the way that she just knew me?
Was it the meaning behind every smile?
I try to walk, but can't leave
Her eyes, they pierce right through me
But I don't care
As long as I am here
